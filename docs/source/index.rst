Hummingbird |version| Documentation!
=======================================
Hummingbird (the bird)
  *Hummingbirds are among the smallest of birds. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing flapping rates, typically around 50 times per second, but possibly as high as 200 times per second, allowing them also to fly at speeds exceeding 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph), backwards or upside down. [..].* (`Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird>`_).

`Hummingbird <http://birdhouse-hummingbird.readthedocs.org>`_ provides a `Web Processing Service (WPS) <http://opengeospatial.org/standards/wps>`_ using `PyWPS <http://pywps.wald.intevation.org>`_ for the climate science community. It has WPS processes for common tools used in climate science like `CDO <https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo>`_ and `cfchecker <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cfchecker>`_. 

Hummingbird is part of the `Birdhouse <http://bird-house.github.io>`_ project.

Hummingbird (the bird)
  *Hummingbirds are among the smallest of birds. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing flapping rates, typically around 50 times per second, but possibly as high as 200 times per second, allowing them also to fly at speeds exceeding 15 m/s (54 km/h; 34 mph), backwards or upside down.

Hummingbird provides CDO and cfchecker as a Web Processing Service.
For installation and configuration read the `documentation <http://birdhouse-hummingbird.readthedocs.org>`_.

Hummingbird is part of the `Birdhouse <http://bird-house.github.io>`_ project.
